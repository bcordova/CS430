        <h1>Undergraduate Research:</h1>
        <p>Students explore their own interest and participate in faculty research through honors projects, 
        individual study courses, and the UMW Summer Science Institute. The University is committed to undergraduate 
        research and offers funding for such projects on a competitive basis. Recent student-projects topics include: 
        computing for mobile devices, robotics, game programming, graphical interface design, and client natural language 
        processing. The department also encourages students to submit papers for technical conference presentation, 
        which can jumpstart a promising research-and-development career.<br>
